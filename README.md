# Chirpify

Chirpify is a fun site I made for my mom's birthday! Sometimes she will hear a bird song and not be able to identify it immediately. She suggested this idea to me as something I could make to help birders learn bird calls, and I thought it was really cool! Feel free to drop me any suggestions that you think would make the site better. Contributions are more than welcome.
